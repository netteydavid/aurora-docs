# Welcome to Project Boreas
Project Boreas is an open source, second layer solution for scaling the Bitcoin network.

Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin was a permissionless, trustless medium of exchange. Essentially, it was to be digital cash that couldn't  be forged or inflated. As Bitcoin became more popular its scaling issues came to the forefront. The goal of this project is to create a decentralized, second layer to the Bitcoin network in an effort to scale it. Bitcoin's original network would act as secure bedrock for this highway. 

Bitcoin is an open source, community project. We believe that any scaling solution should be the same. As such, Project Boreas will be completely open source. Anyone may contributue to or copy the project.
